# File-structure-boilerplate
Basic file structure for a SASS project


This includes a sass boiler plate that uses the 7:1 (7 folders, 1 file) file architecture that i found super handy when creating applications 

I have also included a package.json file that includes everything needed to develop a sass application using node.js.

This includes:
-live server
-webkit prefixer
-compiler
-and compresser

In order to use this boilerplate please make sure you have node installed onto your machine.

TUTORIAL:

1. Open CMD (command prompt)
2. Change directory into main folder (using "cd" in the terminal) 
3. Once opened please run "npm install" and install of fo the node modules that are needed for this project.
4. once node modules have been installed run "npm run start"
5. Live server will start and you can start compiling SASS.

RUN THE BUILD PROCESS:
1.To run the build process make sure your in the folder directory and both live server and sass watch are not running.
2.run "npm run build:css" in the command prompt
